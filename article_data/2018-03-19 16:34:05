Navratilova, who was crowned Wimbledon ladies’ champion nine times, told Panorama she was paid about £15,000 by the BBC for her commentator role at Wimbledon while McEnroe earned between £150,000 and £199,999.
In an interview for Panorama: Britain’s Equal Pay Scandal, which airs on Monday, Navratilova said: “It was a shock because John McEnroe makes at least £150,000 ...
His pay reflects all of this – gender isn’t a factor.”Panorama said it estimated that McEnroe, who was crowned Wimbledon champion three times, appeared about 30 times for the BBC at Wimbledon last year, compared with Navratilova’s 10 appearances.
